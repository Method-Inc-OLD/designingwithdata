# Designing with Data Demo 

This repo holds the code used to train the chatbots for the post and talk 'Designing with Data'; details of talk and post follows:

We envision a future where we are able to interact naturally with our computers, a future where-by our computers know and understand us, delivering personalised and seamless experiences, but our current methods and tools were established in an era where computers were fairly static and the interactions limited. In this talk we explore what it means to design with data; using the example of a chatbot, we look at methodologies and tools that are likely to be adopted by designers in era of AI systems.
